# Deliverable #3 Written Analysis of the Results from the project: Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project for Louise's play Fever comparison to its fundraising goal in a limited duration. 
## In addition to determining the differences in relationships to funds for launch date vs. goals. 

### 
The purpose for this project was to have Louise determine the number of outcomes versus goals in the subcategory for plays based on the data collected to determine fundraiser goals and different campaigns using various pivot charts and visual graphs to support the outcomes based on the outcomes of successful, failed or canceled events. In addition, the second project was based on the outcomes based on goals in incremental goal ranges into three categories percentage of successful outcomes, percentage of failed outcomes, and lastly, the percentage of canceled outcomes. 
Technical reports supported a snapshot for "Outcomes Based on Launch Date Chart" and "Outcomes Based on Goals" with visual charts and graphs. The charts project an overview of two samples, one for plays outcome based on launch dates and the other project for theater outcomes based on the dollar amount for goals. 
## Analysis and Challenges:
- This was random sampling to analyze the category for plays and theaters and the outcomes in the parent category and subcategory. First, I utilized the data from start books.xlm to determine the successful, failed, and canceled outcomes based on launch dates in a data table. As you can see when referring to outcomes, Based on the Launch Date table chart or graph, you can see that based on the monthly totals for successful, failed, and canceled outcomes during the campaign. Louise selected Theather outcomes to determine by launch date the most successful during a twelve-month duration starting with January. The projection was to determine if Louise's play came close to the fundraising goal in a short amount of time. She also wanted to know the different campaigns correlated to their funding goal and dates launched, which projected against Fever (play/theater), which indicated a goal amount of 2,885 and an outcome that fell into a failed range for the launch of July 13, 2016. The theater comparison overall campaign in 2016 successful outcomes was in the midrange of 118,350 for that year compared to the failed outcomes that cumulated to 32,500. Now let's compare Fever to the overall theater outcomes. As we can see in the table and the chart for successful outcomes for that year, 2,185 for the entire three months, February, recording 202, April,194, and July 192 outperformed the failed and canceled outcomes. A mild concern for Theater's failed outcomes attributed total was 1,530 for the duration of the annual period. The failed outcomes peaked within three months. For example, in July, it reached 150, October 149, and June 147. Lastly, on a final note, the number of canceled outcomes total in the Theater was 349 for the number of canceled outcomes. The highest theater cancelations were on July 43, November 37, then, of course, January. 
-  The two conclusions during the project for theater outcomes versus the launch dates, the table indicated that May and June were the most vital months, with 111 outcomes and 100 outcomes, respectively, which is indicated as a reference visually on the line graph. Those two months were at a plateau until July, whereas the successful outcomes descended month by month until reaching the level in December close to the failed outcomes of 37 to 35. Overall, according to the theater outcomes based on the launch as depicted in the graph, the apex in May was the best month, and the successful outcomes tapered off. The successful outcome faced challenges during the project by keeping the successful outcomes for their project versus failed outcomes. The canceled outcomes per month launch dates were shallow, respectively, as indicated in the table and the graph. The descending successful outcomes, as you can see from the graph and the table, indicated a meeting point for both successful and failed outcomes.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date:
-  The "Outcomes Based on Launch Date" table and chart gathered data for twelve months from January to December to analyze the parent category theater relationships between the number of successful, failed, and canceled outcomes versus the launch date with overall grand totals for the twelve-month duration. As you can see in the table and chart "Outcomes Based on Launch Date," each month starting with the successful outcomes, the subsequently failed outcomes are finally canceled with a total for all three outcomes per month. 
 -  Now, let's dive deeper. During the project for theater outcomes versus the launch dates, the table indicated that May and June were the most vital months, with 111 outcomes and 100 outcomes, respectively, which is indicated as a reference visually on the line graph. Those two months were at a plateau until July, whereas the successful outcomes descended month by month until reaching the level in December close to the failed outcomes of 37 to 35. Overall, according to the theater outcomes based on the launch as depicted in the graph, the apex in May was the best month, and the successful outcomes thinned out. The table indicates in May. The total was 166 outcomes consisting of 111 successful outcomes, 52 failed outcomes, and three canceled outcomes. 
 - Secondly, the Theater's outcomes based on launch dates and project data displayed that the successful outcomes started in January at 56. The Theater's total for the annual year was 839. Overall there was a steady increase in March to 56 outcomes, inclined slightly in April to 71 outcomes, inclined again in May to 111 outcomes, steading off in June to 100 outcomes. After that, the successful outcomes dwindled monthly from July onward, ending in December with 37 outcomes.
 - Finally, the table and chart data demonstrate that the number of failed outcomes for Theater that year was 493. The successful outcomes shadow the failed outcomes monthly by a variation starting at a lower rate of 33 outcomes, increasing moderately then simmering off to meet in December the number of failed 35 to successful outcomes of 37 respectively.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals:
-  Next, the second project was "Outcomes Based on Goal," which was to develop a table with the "Number of Successful," "Number of Failed," and the "Number of Canceled" based on the "Total Project" with percentages for Percentage of Successful," "Percentage of Failed" and the "Percentage Canceled" reflective to the goal range. The "Outcomes Based on Goal"table and charted graph visually show and determine the goal amount by incremental ranges (on the x-axis) to show the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled projects on the (y-axis). The ranges are broken down into sections such as less than 1000; 1000 to 4000; 5000 to 9999; 10000 to 14999; 15000 to 19999; 20000 to 24999; 25000 to 29999; 30000 to 34999; 35000 to 39999; 45000 to 44999; 45000 to 44999; 45000 to 49999; greater than 50000.  
- The table and graph show how during the comprehensive range, the goal of successful outcome project starts below the 80% range less than 10000 goal continues 1000 to 4999 with a slight decline then trailing in 5000 to 99999 to slightly below 60%. From 10000 to 14999, the goal projected amount lingers around 60% until 20000 to 24999 of 50% declines to 20%. Next 30000 to 34999 a slight lift to in percentage of successful outcomes to above 20%. From 35000 to 39999 indicated a moderate incline for successful percentage outcomes to above 60% range and continues into 40000 to 44999 range with a successful percentage of outcomes 60% respectfully. In the range of 45000 to 49999 goal amounts, the successful percentage plunges to 0% with no activity indicated during that range. Finally, from 45000 to 49999, a gradual incline to the greater than 50000 range indicated just below 20% for successful outcomes. Overall, the successful ranges throughout the movement in the "outcome based on goal" range indicate intense volatility as the unsuccessful outcomes project increase or decrease the failed outcomes decrease to increase. Overlapping in three ranges during the goal amount of 15000 to 19999; before the 35000 to 39999 range and then overlying at the goal range of 40000 to 44999. 
-  The table and graph show how during the broad range, the goal for the failed outcome projects starts below the 20% range for less than 10000 goals continues incline to 1000 to 4999 with a slight increase incrementally in 5000 to 99999 to slightly above 40%. The failed outcomes from 10000 to 14999 the goal projected amount is steady around above 60% until 20000 to 24999incline to 80% then slight decline in the 25000 to 29999 then to 30000 to 34999 a slight decline just below 40%. The failed outcomes goal range cascades downward to below 40% to the 35000 to 39999 range. The goal range stagnates steadily to 40000 to 44999 below the 40% as the failed outcomes. A sharp incremental climb to 45000 to 49999 range spikes to 100% failed outcome, ending with the greater than 50000 with a light dip just above 90%. The overall indication that the failed outcome throughout the ranges from 1000 is volatile, and as the successful ranges increase, the failed outcomes decrease. 
## Now Louise wanted to compare Fever to the overall play annual 2016:
 - Fever indicated a failed outcome with a goal of $2,485.00 (USD), the percentage funded was 86%, and the average donations were 248.5. The date launched was June 13, 2016. As you can see in the table and graph, the attributing failed outcomes launched for Theater in the "Outcome Based on Launch date" was a total failed outcome of 147 in which Fever was a part of that ran the campaign from July 13, 2016, to July 11, 2016, a little under an entire month. The goal amount fell from 1000 to 4999, which was a 27% failed outcome. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
  -The challenges encountered are that the data set is extensively large, and focusing on Fever in comparison to others was visually displayed; however, the overall data was a significantly larger data sample to compare a smaller project against. It would be more beneficial to see where the campaign fell into the failed outcomes and why. So the data sample may or may not be overall relevant to the answer of where Fever fits into the overall theater projects unless it is measurable to the critical Lousie was comparing where the failed outcomes may significant changes to meet the successful outcome whether that was part of the goal.
## Results
- What conclusions can you draw about the Outcomes based on the Launch Date?
 In conclusion, the significant elements in the "Outcome Based on Launch Date" table and chart data demonstrate that the number of failed outcomes for Theater that year was 493. The successful outcomes parallel the failed outcomes monthly by a variation starting at a lower rate of 33 outcomes, increasing moderately then simmering off to meet in December the number of failed 35 to successful outcomes of 37 respectively.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
 - In conclusion, the overall indication that the successful versus the failed outcome throughout the ranges reflected a significant disparity of failed to successful ranges. Note that as the successful outcomes increase, the failed outcomes decrease, except for overlapping in the various sections of the table and indicated in the graph.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The data set's limitation is based on productions with limited details on how the production was implemented and the target market for entertainment. 
- What are some other possible tables and graphs that we could create?
 - The other possible tables could have been based on annual years comparison for entertainment using bar graphs to compare all three. I would have taken out the canceled outcomes and reflected a notation that canceled outcomes equals zero throughout the "outcome-based range project in the table and the graph.
